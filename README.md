# SkySkirmish

Sky Skirmish is a free to play mobile bullet-hell type game for iOS devices. 

You play as a fighter jet where your main objectives are to survive and destroy enemy aircraft.

## Development

In the beginning we started out by making basic player movement with a set maximum speed, while quickly scaling it up by adding bullets which launch from the player as well as wing cannons and adding stationary enemies with basic initiallizers. Eventually, we figured out how to add health points and change the amount of damage each of the player's projectiles could inflict.

The most challenging part of the development process was the creation of the UIBezierPaths. Having to plot out every path and have them form to different screen sizes was very difficult and required intensive tinkering and problem solving. The programming of the helicopter was also math-intensive, and required working with trigonometry.
