# SkySkirmish

Sky Skirmish is a free to play mobile bullet-hell type game for iOS devices. 

You play as a fighter jet where your main objectives are to survive and destroy enemy aircraft.

## Development

In the beginning we started out by making basic player movement with a set maximum speed, while quickly scaling it up by adding bullets which launch from the player as well as wing cannons and adding stationary enemies with basic initiallizers. Eventually, we figured out how to add health points and change the amount of damage each of the player's projectiles could inflict.

Currently, we are in the middle of designing and inplementing enemy flight paths using UIBezierPaths. We are also adding different types of enemies (such as heliopters) which can drop different power ups to aid you in progressing in the game. We also only have place-holdler art and are working on creating and adding the actualy art.

In the future, we plan to create strutured levels with set events along with a proper UI interface. We also plan to add a scoreboard, a pause button, and enemies shotting back at the player.
